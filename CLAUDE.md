# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL GIT WORKTREE WORKFLOW - DO THIS FIRST! ðŸš¨

**BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES - USE WORKTREES:**

1. Run `git fetch origin main` to get latest from remote
2. Create worktree for new feature: `git worktree add ../feat-descriptive-name feat/descriptive-name`
3. Change to the new worktree: `cd ../feat-descriptive-name`
4. Run `mise trust && mise install` to make tools available
5. Run `bun install` to set up dependencies
6. ONLY THEN start making changes in the isolated worktree

- Always use turbo to run tasks.
- Always use Bun instead of node or npm.
- PR titles must follow conventional commits

## Worktree Benefits

- Each feature branch gets its own isolated working directory
- Never risk contaminating main branch with uncommitted changes
- Can work on multiple features simultaneously in parallel worktrees
- Clean separation between main repo and feature development

## Before Starting Work

- ALWAYS use `/start` command to create proper worktree setup
- Choose a short branch/worktree name based on the work description
- NEVER work directly in main worktree for feature development
- Verify you're in correct worktree with `pwd` and `git branch`
- Each worktree is a complete working copy with its own node_modules and mise config

## Releasing

- Start each new piece of work in a new branch from the latest origin/main. Changes are always submitted via a PR.
- With each commit, review and update pending changesets accordingly.
- Changesets must be written with the package consumer in mind, telling them what they need to know about changes, not just what changed.
- Packages are released manually via GitHub UI, not automatically.
