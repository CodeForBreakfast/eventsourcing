# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL GIT WORKFLOW - DO THIS FIRST! ðŸš¨

**BEFORE ANY CODE CHANGES:**

1. Run `git status` to check current branch
2. Run `git fetch origin main` to get latest
3. Create new feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name`
4. ONLY THEN start making changes

- Always use Bun wherever possible.
- Always use turbo to run tasks.
- PR titles must follow conventional commits

## Before Starting Work

- ALWAYS check current branch with `git status` and `git branch`
- ALWAYS fetch latest from origin/main before creating new branches
- NEVER assume you're in the right branch - orient yourself first
- Verify the repository remote with `git remote -v` if unsure

## Releasing

1. `bun changeset` - create changeset after changes
2. `bun version` - update versions before release
3. `bun release` - publish to npm

- Start each new piece of work in a new branch from the latest origin/main. Changes are always submitted via a PR.
- With each commit, review and update pending changesets accordingly.
- Changesets must be written with the package consumer in mind, telling them what they need to know about changes, not just what changed.
