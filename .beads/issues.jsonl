These test files create floating Effects (Effects that are created but never handled).\n\nExample issue: In test/no-runSync-runPromise.test.ts, Effect.runSync() and Effect.runPromise() create Effects but don't assign or handle them.\n\nThese need to be fixed by either:\n1. Running the Effects to completion\n2. Assigning them to exported variables\n3. Returning them from the test context\n\nThe test files are in packages/eslint-effect/test/*.test.ts\n\nThis was discovered during Effect-LS integration (hp-1) when TypeScript patching enabled compile-time Effect diagnostics.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-10-25T14:28:25.366918+01:00","updated_at":"2025-10-25T14:39:26.441293+01:00","closed_at":"2025-10-25T14:39:26.441293+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"hp-2","depends_on_id":"hp-1","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-10-25T14:28:37.223575+01:00","created_by":"graemefoster"}]}
