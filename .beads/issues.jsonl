This is an imperative pattern that doesn't leverage Effect's functional matching capabilities.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n1. Consistency with Effect patterns: Effect provides Match.tag specifically for discriminated unions with _tag fields. Using it makes the code more idiomatic.\n\n2. Better type inference: Match.tag provides better type narrowing within match branches and ensures exhaustive handling.\n\n3. Reduces imperative style: Type guard functions with if statements are imperative. Match.tag with Match.orElse is functional composition.\n\n4. Avoids side effects: The current pattern often leads to imperative control flow. With Match, we get functional composition.\n\n5.
