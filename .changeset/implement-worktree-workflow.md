Improved development workflow with git worktree integration

This change improves the development experience by implementing a git worktree-based workflow that provides better isolation between feature development and the main branch. The `/start` slash command now creates isolated worktrees for each feature, and the `/automerge` command properly cleans up worktrees after successful merges.

Key benefits for developers:

- Complete isolation of feature branches in separate working directories
- Eliminates risk of contaminating main branch with uncommitted changes
- Allows working on multiple features simultaneously
- Each worktree maintains its own node_modules and mise configuration
- Automatic mise trust and dependency installation in new worktrees
