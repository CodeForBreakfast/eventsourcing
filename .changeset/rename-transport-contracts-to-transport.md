**BREAKING CHANGE**: Rename package from `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-transport-contracts` to `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-transport`

The transport contracts package has been renamed to better reflect its role as the core transport abstraction layer. No API changes - only the package name has changed.
