Simplify command registry API by removing unnecessary examples and type safety demonstrations. The command registry now provides a clean, minimal interface focused on behavior rather than showcasing TypeScript features. Removed verbose documentation and example files while maintaining full compile-time command name validation and exhaustive matching capabilities.
