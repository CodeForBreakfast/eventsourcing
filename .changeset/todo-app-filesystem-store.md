'@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-example-todo': patch
---

Updated the todo-app example to demonstrate filesystem-based event persistence. The CLI now uses the filesystem store instead of the in-memory store, allowing todos to persist across application restarts. Added a `demo` script for easy testing of the filesystem store integration.
