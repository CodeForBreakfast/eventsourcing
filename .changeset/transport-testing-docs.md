Improve transport testing contract documentation

Enhanced documentation for the transport testing contracts package with comprehensive README and updated contract test files. Key improvements include:

- Added comprehensive README.md for transport tests explaining contract structure and usage
- Updated contract test files to reference real implementations instead of placeholder examples
- Removed references to unimplemented optional transport behaviors
- Clarified testing patterns and best practices for transport implementations

These changes make it easier for developers to understand and use the testing contracts when implementing new transport mechanisms.
