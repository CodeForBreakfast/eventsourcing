fix(eslint-effect): correct TypeScript examples and add missing validate:docs script

Fixed invalid TypeScript examples in README.md that were causing type errors. Examples now include proper imports, type declarations, and correct Match pattern usage. Also added missing validate:docs script to package.json for documentation validation.
