Enhanced CI/CD validation to prevent release failures. The new comprehensive validation ensures:

- All TypeScript packages build with proper declarations
- No executable file permissions that break GitHub API commits
- Packages are ready for npm publish before merging
- Complete validation of the entire release pipeline

This prevents issues where PRs pass checks but fail during release, ensuring a smooth deployment process.
