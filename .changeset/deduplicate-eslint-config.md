Improve ESLint configuration maintainability by extracting shared rules into named constants. All plugin configurations, language options, rule sets, and syntax restrictions are now defined once and referenced throughout, making it easier to understand and modify linting rules consistently across the codebase. Test files now also enforce simple pipe patterns to maintain code quality standards.
