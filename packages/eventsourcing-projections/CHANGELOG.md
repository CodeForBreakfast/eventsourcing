### Patch Changes

- [#126](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/126) [`31dbe34`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/31dbe348132aea1d65fa64493533a614a404bd25) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improved development workflow with git worktree integration

  This change improves the development experience by implementing a git worktree-based workflow that provides better isolation between feature development and the main branch. The `/start` slash command now creates isolated worktrees for each feature, and the `/automerge` command properly cleans up worktrees after successful merges.

  Key benefits for developers:
  - Complete isolation of feature branches in separate working directories
  - Eliminates risk of contaminating main branch with uncommitted changes
  - Allows working on multiple features simultaneously
  - Each worktree maintains its own node_modules and mise configuration
  - Automatic mise trust and dependency installation in new worktrees

  Enhanced the CI workflow to use a more intelligent cache strategy that enables better cache reuse across commits and between PR runs and main branch builds. CI builds now complete significantly faster when dependencies haven't changed.

  This is purely an internal development workflow improvement that does not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

- [#128](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/128) [`5cac87e`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/5cac87e9edf83c7b8fce8f1ba0c51d576ca92c6d) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improve development workflow with enhanced validation scripts

  Enhanced the internal validation and release preparation scripts to use modern Turbo-based architecture. Package validation is now faster and more reliable thanks to improved caching and parallel execution. The validation process now properly separates discovery, orchestration, and execution concerns for better maintainability.

  Changes are purely internal to the development workflow and do not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

  Eliminate duplicate APIs and ensure consistent Effect terminology throughout the codebase. All factory functions now use the Effect `make*` convention, and redundant aliases have been removed for a cleaner API surface.
  - Replace `create*` factory functions with `make*` (Effect convention)
  - Update WebSocket layer terminology (`createWebSocketProtocolStack` → `makeWebSocketProtocolLayer`)
  - Remove backward compatibility aliases and redundant exports
  - Standardize all test interface methods to use Effect naming patterns

  This cleanup eliminates API confusion and ensures developers have single, canonical names for each piece of functionality following proper Effect patterns.

  All packages now use bun:test instead of vitest for testing. This change removes vitest as a dependency across all packages while maintaining the same testing functionality. Test imports have been updated from 'vitest' to 'bun:test' and configuration files have been cleaned up to remove vitest references.

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix release pipeline failures caused by TypeScript build issues

  The release process was failing because packages with `workspace:*` dependencies were rebuilding during publish via `prepublishOnly` hooks. This caused TypeScript compilation errors when dependent packages tried to build in parallel without access to their dependencies' declaration files.

  **Solution:**
  - Removed `prepublishOnly` hooks from all packages (turbo already handles build order correctly)
  - Updated release script to use `changeset publish` directly instead of custom turbo publish tasks
  - Ensured all packages are built in dependency order before publishing begins

  This ensures a smooth release process where:
  1. All packages build in correct dependency order (respecting workspace dependencies)
  2. Changesets handles publishing with proper version resolution
  3. No parallel rebuild issues during the publish phase

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Simplified release validation using changesets' native tools. The CI now validates:
  - Changeset status to ensure changes have appropriate version bumps
  - Build success for all packages
  - Publish readiness via changesets publish --dry-run

  This provides focused, relevant validation without unnecessary checks, ensuring smooth releases while keeping CI fast and maintainable.

The changeset validation now:
  - Detects when code changes are made without changesets (preventing npm republish failures)
  - Checks if package versions already exist on npm
  - Provides clear guidance on creating changesets with consumer-focused messages
  - Distinguishes between code changes (requiring changesets) and documentation-only changes (optional)

  The prepublishOnly script was doing a clean build (`clean && build`) which broke the dependency chain established by Turbo's build ordering. This caused packages that depend on other workspace packages to fail TypeScript compilation during publishing because their dependencies' TypeScript definitions weren't available.

  Changed prepublishOnly from `bun run clean && bun run build` to just `bun run build` to maintain the build artifacts and dependency chain established by the main build process.

  The build process was not properly generating TypeScript definition files for published packages due to incremental compilation cache issues. This fix adds the `--force` flag to the TypeScript compiler to ensure definition files are always generated during the build process.

  This resolves issues where consumers of these packages would not have proper TypeScript intellisense and type checking.

  The published packages incorrectly included `workspace:*` protocol in their dependencies, making them impossible to install outside the monorepo. This was caused by changesets not supporting Bun's workspace protocol.

  The fix updates the release workflow to:
  1. Run `bun update` after versioning to resolve workspace references
  2. Use `bun publish` directly instead of `changeset publish`
  3. Run `changeset tag` to create git tags after publishing

  This ensures published packages have proper version constraints instead of workspace protocols.

### Minor Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/47) [`73ca9d4`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/73ca9d44adca717e75edc04b6dd6d02fdd8afbf1) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - feat!: Simplify EventStore API to just read and subscribe methods

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### EventStore Interface Simplified

  The EventStore interface now has just three methods:
  - `write`: Write events to a stream
  - `read`: Read historical events only (no live updates)
  - `subscribe`: Read historical events then continue with live updates

  ### Removed APIs
  - **Removed `readHistorical` method** - Use `read` instead (it now returns only historical events)
  - **Removed `ReadParams` and `ReadOptions` types** - Use EventStreamPosition with Stream combinators
  - **Removed complex parameter overloading** - Methods now have single, clear parameter types

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Reading Historical Events

  ```typescript
  // Before
  eventStore.readHistorical({ streamId, eventNumber });

  // After
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber });
  ```

  ### Advanced Operations with Stream Combinators

  ```typescript
  // Reading a range (before)
  eventStore.read({
    streamId,
    fromEventNumber: 50,
    toEventNumber: 100,
  });

  // Reading a range (after)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber: 50 }).pipe(
    Effect.map(Stream.take(51)) // take events 50-100
  );

  // Reading in reverse (before)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, direction: 'backward' });

  // Reading in reverse (after)
  eventStore
    .read({ streamId, eventNumber: 0 })
    .pipe(
      Effect.map(
        flow(Stream.runCollect, Effect.map(Chunk.reverse), Effect.flatMap(Stream.fromChunk))
      )
    );
  ```

  ## Benefits
  - **Clearer API**: Explicit separation between historical reads and live subscriptions
  - **Simpler types**: No complex union types or parameter overloading
  - **Better composability**: Leverage Effect's powerful Stream combinators
  - **Smaller API surface**: Fewer methods to understand and maintain

  ## Notes

  This change removes theoretical optimizations that were never implemented (like database-level filtering for ranges). These can be added back as specialized methods if performance requirements demand it in the future.
