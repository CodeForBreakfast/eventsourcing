### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix release pipeline failures caused by TypeScript build issues

  The release process was failing because packages with `workspace:*` dependencies were rebuilding during publish via `prepublishOnly` hooks. This caused TypeScript compilation errors when dependent packages tried to build in parallel without access to their dependencies' declaration files.

  **Solution:**
  - Removed `prepublishOnly` hooks from all packages (turbo already handles build order correctly)
  - Updated release script to use `changeset publish` directly instead of custom turbo publish tasks
  - Ensured all packages are built in dependency order before publishing begins

  This ensures a smooth release process where:
  1. All packages build in correct dependency order (respecting workspace dependencies)
  2. Changesets handles publishing with proper version resolution
  3. No parallel rebuild issues during the publish phase

The CI now validates:
  - Changeset status to ensure changes have appropriate version bumps
  - Build success for all packages
  - Publish readiness via changesets publish --dry-run

  This provides focused, relevant validation without unnecessary checks, ensuring smooth releases while keeping CI fast and maintainable.

  The prepublishOnly script was doing a clean build (`clean && build`) which broke the dependency chain established by Turbo's build ordering. This caused packages that depend on other workspace packages to fail TypeScript compilation during publishing because their dependencies' TypeScript definitions weren't available.

  Changed prepublishOnly from `bun run clean && bun run build` to just `bun run build` to maintain the build artifacts and dependency chain established by the main build process.

  The build process was not properly generating TypeScript definition files for published packages due to incremental compilation cache issues. This fix adds the `--force` flag to the TypeScript compiler to ensure definition files are always generated during the build process.

  This resolves issues where consumers of these packages would not have proper TypeScript intellisense and type checking.

  The published packages incorrectly included `workspace:*` protocol in their dependencies, making them impossible to install outside the monorepo. This was caused by changesets not supporting Bun's workspace protocol.

  The fix updates the release workflow to:
  1. Run `bun update` after versioning to resolve workspace references
  2. Use `bun publish` directly instead of `changeset publish`
  3. Run `changeset tag` to create git tags after publishing

  This ensures published packages have proper version constraints instead of workspace protocols.

  This patch verifies that the changeset publish process properly replaces workspace:\* with actual version numbers when publishing to npm.

### Minor Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/47) [`73ca9d4`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/73ca9d44adca717e75edc04b6dd6d02fdd8afbf1) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - feat!: Simplify EventStore API to just read and subscribe methods

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### EventStore Interface Simplified

  The EventStore interface now has just three methods:
  - `write`: Write events to a stream
  - `read`: Read historical events only (no live updates)
  - `subscribe`: Read historical events then continue with live updates

  ### Removed APIs
  - **Removed `readHistorical` method** - Use `read` instead (it now returns only historical events)
  - **Removed `ReadParams` and `ReadOptions` types** - Use EventStreamPosition with Stream combinators
  - **Removed complex parameter overloading** - Methods now have single, clear parameter types

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Reading Historical Events

  ```typescript
  // Before
  eventStore.readHistorical({ streamId, eventNumber });

  // After
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber });
  ```

  ### Advanced Operations with Stream Combinators

  ```typescript
  // Reading a range (before)
  eventStore.read({
    streamId,
    fromEventNumber: 50,
    toEventNumber: 100,
  });

  // Reading a range (after)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber: 50 }).pipe(
    Effect.map(Stream.take(51)) // take events 50-100
  );

  // Reading in reverse (before)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, direction: 'backward' });

  // Reading in reverse (after)
  eventStore
    .read({ streamId, eventNumber: 0 })
    .pipe(
      Effect.map(
        flow(Stream.runCollect, Effect.map(Chunk.reverse), Effect.flatMap(Stream.fromChunk))
      )
    );
  ```

  ## Benefits
  - **Clearer API**: Explicit separation between historical reads and live subscriptions
  - **Simpler types**: No complex union types or parameter overloading
  - **Better composability**: Leverage Effect's powerful Stream combinators
  - **Smaller API surface**: Fewer methods to understand and maintain

  ## Notes

  This change removes theoretical optimizations that were never implemented (like database-level filtering for ranges). These can be added back as specialized methods if performance requirements demand it in the future.

    MyEventStore,
    EventStoreServiceInterface<MyEvent>
  >() {}
