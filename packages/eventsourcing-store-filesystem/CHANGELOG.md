  Internal dependency `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-transport-inmemory` was updated with test refactorings. No functional changes to this package.

### Patch Changes

- [#332](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/332) [`e177936`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/e177936ba898dcf8dfdaabbf413cd483cd5b90b7) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Introduce `StreamEvent<T>` type to consolidate event-with-position pattern

  This change introduces a new `StreamEvent<T>` type that represents an event with its stream position metadata. This replaces the verbose `{ readonly position: EventStreamPosition; readonly event: T }` pattern used throughout the codebase.

  **What changed:**
  - Added `StreamEvent<T>` type and Schema to `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store`
  - Updated `EventStore.subscribeAll()` to return `Stream<StreamEvent<T>>` instead of `Stream<{ position, event }>`
  - Refactored internal implementations in postgres, inmemory, and filesystem stores to use the new type
  - Removed redundant object mapping in SQL event store subscription

  **Migration:**
  If you're using `EventStore.subscribeAll()`, you can now use the `StreamEvent<T>` type for better type inference:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  type EventWithPos = { readonly position: EventStreamPosition; readonly event: MyEvent };

  // After
  import { type StreamEvent } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store';
  type EventWithPos = StreamEvent<MyEvent>;
  ```

  The change is backward compatible as the structure remains identical.

This internal dependency update has no impact on the public API of these packages.

### Patch Changes

- [#278](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/278) [`5fdd207`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/5fdd207a40c5e5f7b6ec8102f28e8d729a56290f) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fixed TypeScript declaration file generation to ensure all packages publish with complete type definitions. This resolves an issue where some type declaration files were missing from published packages, which could cause TypeScript errors when importing these packages.

- Updated dependencies [[`5fdd207`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/5fdd207a40c5e5f7b6ec8102f28e8d729a56290f)]:

### Patch Changes

- [#259](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/259) [`df504f3`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/df504f3658772dbb7f5c6538288d67a7f85a29d2) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Add Effect-native assertions and new ESLint rules

  **New Features:**
  - **buntest**: Added Effect-native assertion utilities (`expectEffect`, `toSucceedWith`, `toFailWith`) and a new ESLint rule `prefer-effect-assertions` to enforce their usage
  - **eslint-effect**: Added two new rules: `no-effect-if-option-check` and `prefer-get-or-undefined`

  **Bug Fixes & Improvements:**
  - Replaced `Effect.sync(expect())` patterns with Effect-native assertions across test suites
  - Removed unnecessary function aliases to improve code readability
  - Fixed nested pipe calls and redundant Effect.sync wrappers

- Updated dependencies [[`df504f3`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/df504f3658772dbb7f5c6538288d67a7f85a29d2)]:

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#247](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/247) [`75a1402`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/75a140291015876f34014f264f2d3718bda5fb65) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Add filesystem-based event store implementation for learning and debugging

  This new package provides a simple filesystem-based event store that stores events as human-readable JSON files. Each stream gets its own directory, and events are stored as sequentially numbered files (0.json, 1.json, etc.).

  **Features:**
  - Human-readable JSON storage format
  - Stream-based directory organization
  - Full EventStore interface implementation
  - Concurrency conflict detection
  - Perfect for understanding event sourcing concepts

  **Limitations:**
  - Not recommended for production use
  - Live subscriptions work only within a single process (uses in-memory PubSub)
  - Performance not optimized for large event volumes

  This implementation is ideal for:
  - Learning event sourcing concepts
  - Debugging event streams by inspecting files directly
  - Quick prototyping
  - Educational demonstrations

  For production use, consider `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store-postgres` or `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store-inmemory` for testing.
