/**
 * WebSocket Transport Unit Tests
 *
 * Currently testing basic connection failure scenarios that don't require mocking.
 * More complex edge cases would require either:
 * - Global state mocking (anti-pattern used in origin/main)
 * - Refactoring to use @effect/platform/Socket abstraction
 * - Custom test WebSocket server with controllable behavior
 *
 * CONTEXT:
 * The original tests used global state to mock WebSocket behavior, which allowed
 * testing of edge cases but violated isolation principles. This file currently
 * contains minimal tests while we evaluate the best approach for comprehensive testing.

/**
 * EDGE CASES NOT CURRENTLY TESTED (compared to origin/main):
 *
 * The following scenarios were previously tested using global state mocking
 * but are not covered by the current minimal test suite:
 *
 * 1. CONNECTION LIFECYCLE:
 *    - WebSocket state transitions (CONNECTING → OPEN)
 *    - Connection state stream updates
 *
 * 2. ERROR SCENARIOS:
 *    - WebSocket error event before onopen
 *    - WebSocket close before open (connection refused)
 *    - State transitions with errors (connecting → error → disconnected)
 *
 * 3. MESSAGE HANDLING:
 *    - Incoming message delivery to subscribers
 *    - Malformed JSON message handling (should be silently dropped)
 *
 * 4. PUBLISHING CONSTRAINTS:
 *    - Publishing when not connected (should fail with TransportError)
 *
 * TESTING APPROACH OPTIONS TO CONSIDER:
 *
 * Option 1: Refactor to use @effect/platform/Socket
 *    - Provides proper dependency injection through Effect's service pattern
 *    - Socket interface is mockable without global state
 *    - Would require complete rewrite of transport implementation
 *    - Best for new transports or major version updates
 *
 * Option 2: Dependency injection for WebSocket factory
 *    - Minimal change to existing code
 *    - Allows controlled testing without global state
 *    - Similar to what was partially attempted with WebSocketFactory
 *
 * Option 3: Test WebSocket server with controllable behavior
 *    - Tests real WebSocket protocol behavior
 *    - No mocking needed
 *    - Requires additional test infrastructure
 *
 * Option 4: Keep minimal tests with integration test coverage
 *    - Simplest approach
 *    - Integration tests cover main functionality
 *    - Some edge cases remain untested
 *
 * Note: Integration tests currently cover basic functionality including
 * connection, messaging, and disconnection with real WebSocket connections.
