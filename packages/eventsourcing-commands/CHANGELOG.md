### Minor Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/157) [`2b03f0f`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/2b03f0faea585e54ac3488f6f5f9c97629eb1222) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Remove deprecated Command type export and clean up legacy code

  **BREAKING CHANGE**: The deprecated `Command` type export has been removed from `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands`. Use `WireCommand` instead for transport layer commands.
  - Removed deprecated `Command` type export - use `WireCommand` for clarity about transport layer vs domain commands
  - Updated all internal references from `Command` to `WireCommand`
  - Removed migration guides and backward compatibility documentation
  - Cleaned up legacy helper functions and test comments

  To update your code:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { Command } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands';

  // After
  import { WireCommand } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands';
  ```

- [#171](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/171) [`ae77963`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/ae7796342df299997ece012b7090f1ce9190b0a4) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Remove factory functions with default type parameters to enforce explicit type specification

  Factory functions that previously allowed default `unknown` type parameters have been removed. You must now create service tags directly using `Context.GenericTag` with explicit types.

  **Migration guide:**

  Before:

  ```typescript
  const EventStoreService = EventStore<UserEvent>();
  const ProjectionStoreService = ProjectionStore<UserProjection>();
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  const UserEventStore = Context.GenericTag<EventStore<UserEvent>, EventStore<UserEvent>>(
    'UserEventStore'
  );
  const UserProjectionStore = Context.GenericTag<
    ProjectionStore<UserProjection>,
    ProjectionStore<UserProjection>
  >('UserProjectionStore');
  ```

  This change enforces domain-specific types throughout your codebase, preventing accidental use of `unknown` types in domain code while keeping generic types only at serialization boundaries.

  **What's changed:**
  - Removed `EventStore()`, `ProjectionStore()`, and `SnapshotStore()` factory functions
  - Removed `StreamHandler()` and `StreamHandlerLive()` factory functions
  - Removed default type parameter from `DomainCommand<TPayload>` interface
  - Updated documentation to reflect the new pattern

### Patch Changes

- [#200](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/200) [`1a4b174`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/1a4b1743ba8edd7bf1a359468bae5dc8218ddf43) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enhanced ESLint rules to better detect unnecessary function wrappers. The custom rule now correctly identifies when `(x) => pipe(x, fn)` is redundant while allowing valid cases like `(x) => pipe(SomeService, fn)`. This improves code quality by preventing unnecessary indirection while preserving valid functional composition patterns.

- [#175](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/175) [`8503302`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/850330219126aac119ad10f0c9471dc8b89d773a) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce simplified pipe usage patterns

  This update improves code maintainability and readability by enforcing consistent functional programming patterns. The codebase now exclusively uses the standalone `pipe()` function instead of method-based `.pipe()` calls, eliminates nested pipe compositions in favor of named helper functions, and removes curried function calls. These changes make the code easier to understand and debug while maintaining the same functionality.

- [#198](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/198) [`460784f`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/460784fb8d0c31b1d5b4b122d73a4807e2ce9bbe) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix all TypeScript code examples in documentation to pass validation. All examples now compile successfully with proper imports, type declarations, and adherence to functional programming patterns using pipe() composition.

- [#206](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/206) [`322a7ab`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/322a7aba4778b3f2e1cf4aa6ad4abc37414af8a7) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - CI workflow now uses concurrency groups to prevent duplicate workflow runs when the release bot updates PRs. This eliminates wasted compute resources from race conditions in GitHub's API-based commit handling.

- [#159](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/159) [`04e27b8`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/04e27b86f885c7a7746580f83460de3be7bae1bb) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix turbo cache invalidation for lint tasks to ensure CI properly detects code changes
  - Simplified lint task input patterns to prevent cache inconsistencies
  - Added tracking for root package.json and bun.lock to invalidate cache when dependencies change
  - Added missing TSX test file patterns to ensure all test files are tracked
  - Removed duplicate and non-existent file patterns that were causing unreliable cache behavior

  This ensures that lint errors are always caught in CI and prevents false-positive builds from stale cache.

- [#169](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/169) [`abfb14d`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/abfb14d261138b629a31a2b0f86bd17b77f56720) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Modernized service definitions to use Effect-TS 2.3+ patterns. Services now use `Context.Tag` instead of `Effect.Tag` with inlined service shapes, providing better type inference and cleaner code. Generic services use the `Context.GenericTag` factory pattern for proper type parameter support.

  For most users, these are internal improvements with no breaking changes. If you're directly referencing service types (like `CommandRegistryService`), use `Context.Tag.Service<typeof ServiceName>` to extract the service type instead.

- [#203](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/203) [`d2b1c32`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/d2b1c329050725ad7dad65442514387972d1d1f4) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Code quality improvements: All packages now follow stricter functional programming patterns by removing type assertions in Effect callbacks. The codebase uses proper Schema validation and runtime type checking instead of unsafe type casts, improving type safety and code reliability.

- [#179](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/179) [`02f67ff`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/02f67ffe83a70fceebe5ee8d848e0a858529319b) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Replace direct `_tag` property access with Effect type guards throughout the codebase. This change improves type safety and follows Effect's recommended patterns for working with discriminated unions. The transport packages now properly validate incoming messages using Schema validation instead of unsafe type casts.

- [#180](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/180) [`b481714`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b4817141e319d830f10f1914b8a12935ed10fbf8) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce documented justifications for all ESLint rule suppressions

  All `eslint-disable` comments now require a description explaining why the rule is being suppressed. This improves code maintainability by documenting the reasoning behind each exception to the linting rules.

  Added comprehensive immutability checks using ESLint's functional programming rules to enforce readonly types throughout the codebase. This improves type safety by preventing accidental mutations of parameters and return values.
  - Added `type-fest` dependency where needed for `ReadonlyDeep` utility type
  - Applied `ReadonlyDeep` to function parameters requiring deep immutability
  - Added `readonly` modifiers to arrays and interface properties
  - Strategic ESLint disable comments for Effect library types that require internal mutability

  These changes ensure better type safety without affecting runtime behavior or breaking existing APIs.

- Updated dependencies [[`b1a2f97`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b1a2f9710bf40d879b1cbaa53ca001664d88f9df), [`6395dc3`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/6395dc36c02168a7edce261f4270c8f1e0ba34c4)]:

The new API uses Effect's `Match.exhaustive` to ensure all command types are handled at compile time, eliminating runtime handler lookups and providing stronger TypeScript inference within each match arm.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - `createRegistration()` and registration-based API removed
  - `makeCommandRegistry()` now takes `(commands, matcher)` instead of `registrations`
  - `CommandHandler` interface replaced with functional pattern matching

  **Migration:**
  Replace handler registrations with a single matcher function using `Match.value()` and `Match.exhaustive` for compile-time command handling safety.

  This change improves the development experience by implementing a git worktree-based workflow that provides better isolation between feature development and the main branch. The `/start` slash command now creates isolated worktrees for each feature, and the `/automerge` command properly cleans up worktrees after successful merges.

  Key benefits for developers:
  - Complete isolation of feature branches in separate working directories
  - Eliminates risk of contaminating main branch with uncommitted changes
  - Allows working on multiple features simultaneously
  - Each worktree maintains its own node_modules and mise configuration
  - Automatic mise trust and dependency installation in new worktrees

- [#129](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/129) [`565fff4`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/565fff49f7e6878e8cb801bd2351a723bf2cc067) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improve CI performance with enhanced Turbo cache strategy

  Enhanced the CI workflow to use a more intelligent cache strategy that enables better cache reuse across commits and between PR runs and main branch builds. CI builds now complete significantly faster when dependencies haven't changed.

  This is purely an internal development workflow improvement that does not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

- [#130](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/130) [`1ee3bf3`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/1ee3bf3ad919580ae4e00edfc9defc5776f9b94e) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improved CI/CD infrastructure with standardized mise-based tool management and optimized caching strategies for faster builds and more reliable deployments.

  Enhanced the internal validation and release preparation scripts to use modern Turbo-based architecture. Package validation is now faster and more reliable thanks to improved caching and parallel execution. The validation process now properly separates discovery, orchestration, and execution concerns for better maintainability.

  Changes are purely internal to the development workflow and do not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

The new system provides complete type safety for command dispatch while maintaining clean API design.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - Command registry is now immutable - all commands must be registered at construction time
  - Removed mutable `register()` methods in favor of declarative configuration
  - Updated error handling to use structured error types instead of strings

  **New Features:**
  - Exhaustive command name matching prevents dispatching unknown commands at compile time
  - Immutable command registry with zero runtime mutations
  - Type-safe command validation with Effect Schema integration
  - Comprehensive command result types with detailed error information

  **Developer Experience:**
  - Clean, minimal API focused on behavior over type demonstrations
  - Compile-time guarantees for command name validity
  - Automatic type inference for command payloads and handlers
  - Simplified test suite focused on actual functionality

- [#103](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/103) [`0c99b22`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/0c99b22849ba2a0b9211790b0f3334c3a7a0471e) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Separate CQRS command types into dedicated package for better architecture

  **New Package: `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands`**
  - Introduces a dedicated package for CQRS command types and schemas
  - Contains `Command` and `CommandResult` schemas that were previously in the store package
  - Establishes proper separation between domain concepts (commands) and event storage
  - Includes comprehensive test coverage and documentation

  **Breaking changes for `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store`:**
  - Removed `Command` and `CommandResult` types - these are now in the commands package
  - Store package now focuses purely on event streaming and storage concepts
  - Updated description to reflect pure event streaming focus

  **Updated packages:**
  - `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-aggregates`: Updated to import command types from commands package
  - `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-protocol-default`: Updated to import command types from commands package

  This change establishes cleaner architectural boundaries:
  - **Store**: Pure event streaming and storage
  - **Commands**: CQRS command types and schemas
  - **Aggregates**: Domain modeling (uses both events and commands)
  - **Protocol**: Transport implementation (uses both events and commands)
