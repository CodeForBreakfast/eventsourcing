# @codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-testing-contracts

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#85](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/85) [`fe2cf43`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/fe2cf43ea701843ef79df0f2de936fb0c2b3f91a) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Standardize API naming to follow Effect conventions

  Eliminate duplicate APIs and ensure consistent Effect terminology throughout the codebase. All factory functions now use the Effect `make*` convention, and redundant aliases have been removed for a cleaner API surface.
  - Replace `create*` factory functions with `make*` (Effect convention)
  - Update WebSocket layer terminology (`createWebSocketProtocolStack` → `makeWebSocketProtocolLayer`)
  - Remove backward compatibility aliases and redundant exports
  - Standardize all test interface methods to use Effect naming patterns

  This cleanup eliminates API confusion and ensures developers have single, canonical names for each piece of functionality following proper Effect patterns.

- [#100](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/100) [`a7d6249`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/a7d6249f4cb6692153e05d6e30fff268fa4453cd) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Add minimal failing e2e test framework for complete system integration

  This adds a comprehensive end-to-end test that demonstrates the complete event sourcing flow from frontend command sending through to event persistence and subscription. The test includes:
  - High-level EventSourcingClient service for clean frontend integration
  - Server-side protocol handling stubs for bridging transport to command processing
  - Event publishing stubs for streaming events back to clients
  - Complete stack rebuild pattern to verify true event persistence
  - Proper Effect functional programming patterns with tagged errors and Layer composition

  The test is currently skipped as it contains only minimal stubs that fail with "not implemented" errors. This serves as a specification for the remaining integration work needed to complete the event sourcing system.

  Key components added:
  - EventSourcingClient service with subscribeToStream/sendCommand methods
  - ServerProtocolHandler service for processing commands
  - EventPublisher service for streaming events to subscribers
  - Full system test demonstrating command → processing → events → persistence flow

  The transport contracts package has been renamed to better reflect its role as the core transport abstraction layer. No API changes - only the package name has changed.

### Patch Changes

- [#101](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/101) [`d4063a3`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/d4063a351d83d2830e27dfc88972559de74096db) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce consistent Effect syntax by forbidding Effect.gen usage

  Adds ESLint rule to prevent use of Effect.gen in favor of pipe-based Effect composition. This ensures consistent code style and encourages the use of the more explicit pipe syntax throughout the codebase. All existing Effect.gen usage has been refactored to use Effect.pipe patterns.

- [#99](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/99) [`b8fa706`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b8fa706fa4a99772979dca89079205dbd257e3dc) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Remove all vitest dependencies and references in favor of bun:test

  All packages now use bun:test instead of vitest for testing. This change removes vitest as a dependency across all packages while maintaining the same testing functionality. Test imports have been updated from 'vitest' to 'bun:test' and configuration files have been cleaned up to remove vitest references.

- [#124](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/124) [`4b275ed`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/4b275ed99a18b2f27cda711f7d9692cb42cd1f66) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improve transport testing contract documentation

  Enhanced documentation for the transport testing contracts package with comprehensive README and updated contract test files. Key improvements include:
  - Added comprehensive README.md for transport tests explaining contract structure and usage
  - Updated contract test files to reference real implementations instead of placeholder examples
  - Removed references to unimplemented optional transport behaviors
  - Clarified testing patterns and best practices for transport implementations

  These changes make it easier for developers to understand and use the testing contracts when implementing new transport mechanisms.

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix release pipeline failures caused by TypeScript build issues

  The release process was failing because packages with `workspace:*` dependencies were rebuilding during publish via `prepublishOnly` hooks. This caused TypeScript compilation errors when dependent packages tried to build in parallel without access to their dependencies' declaration files.

  **Solution:**
  - Removed `prepublishOnly` hooks from all packages (turbo already handles build order correctly)
  - Updated release script to use `changeset publish` directly instead of custom turbo publish tasks
  - Ensured all packages are built in dependency order before publishing begins

  This ensures a smooth release process where:
  1. All packages build in correct dependency order (respecting workspace dependencies)
  2. Changesets handles publishing with proper version resolution
  3. No parallel rebuild issues during the publish phase

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Simplified release validation using changesets' native tools. The CI now validates:
  - Changeset status to ensure changes have appropriate version bumps
  - Build success for all packages
  - Publish readiness via changesets publish --dry-run

  This provides focused, relevant validation without unnecessary checks, ensuring smooth releases while keeping CI fast and maintainable.

### Patch Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/73) [`7cec47a`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/7cec47a3cf6741febd99f96dec4cadb1923543c2) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Documentation updates to match current codebase implementation:
  - Fixed incorrect package names and import paths
  - Updated API examples and function signatures
  - Corrected WebSocket usage patterns
  - Removed outdated temporary documentation

- [#74](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/74) [`ff5231c`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/ff5231c27122a47839b3aedf162c00f30f5e3257) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improved CI validation to prevent release failures. The changeset validation now:
  - Detects when code changes are made without changesets (preventing npm republish failures)
  - Checks if package versions already exist on npm
  - Provides clear guidance on creating changesets with consumer-focused messages
  - Distinguishes between code changes (requiring changesets) and documentation-only changes (optional)

- Updated dependencies [[`7cec47a`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/7cec47a3cf6741febd99f96dec4cadb1923543c2), [`ff5231c`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/ff5231c27122a47839b3aedf162c00f30f5e3257)]:
