## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix release pipeline failures caused by TypeScript build issues

  The release process was failing because packages with `workspace:*` dependencies were rebuilding during publish via `prepublishOnly` hooks. This caused TypeScript compilation errors when dependent packages tried to build in parallel without access to their dependencies' declaration files.

  **Solution:**
  - Removed `prepublishOnly` hooks from all packages (turbo already handles build order correctly)
  - Updated release script to use `changeset publish` directly instead of custom turbo publish tasks
  - Ensured all packages are built in dependency order before publishing begins

  This ensures a smooth release process where:
  1. All packages build in correct dependency order (respecting workspace dependencies)
  2. Changesets handles publishing with proper version resolution
  3. No parallel rebuild issues during the publish phase

The CI now validates:
  - Changeset status to ensure changes have appropriate version bumps
  - Build success for all packages
  - Publish readiness via changesets publish --dry-run

  This provides focused, relevant validation without unnecessary checks, ensuring smooth releases while keeping CI fast and maintainable.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/73) [`7cec47a`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/7cec47a3cf6741febd99f96dec4cadb1923543c2) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Documentation updates to match current codebase implementation:
  - Fixed incorrect package names and import paths
  - Updated API examples and function signatures
  - Corrected WebSocket usage patterns
  - Removed outdated temporary documentation

- [#74](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/74) [`ff5231c`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/ff5231c27122a47839b3aedf162c00f30f5e3257) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improved CI validation to prevent release failures. The changeset validation now:
  - Detects when code changes are made without changesets (preventing npm republish failures)
  - Checks if package versions already exist on npm
  - Provides clear guidance on creating changesets with consumer-focused messages
  - Distinguishes between code changes (requiring changesets) and documentation-only changes (optional)

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#67](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/67) [`b7da1d2`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b7da1d24b822cf3b7853f659a6df161b7c6126e5) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Complete refactor of transport layer with proper layered architecture

  ### Transport & Protocol Improvements
  - **New simplified transport contracts** - Minimal Client/Server namespaces with clean separation of concerns
  - **Protocol layer separation** - Clear boundary between data transport and business logic
  - **Functional Effect-based design** - Replaced 3900+ lines of OOP with functional primitives
  - **Zero global state** - All state properly managed through Effect refs

  ### New Packages
  - `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-protocol-default` - Simplified protocol implementation with client/server logic
  - `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-testing-contracts` - Reusable contract tests for transport implementations

  ### Breaking Changes
  - Removed `eventsourcing-protocol-contracts` package (merged into protocol-default)
  - WebSocket transport completely rewritten with new API
  - Transport implementations now use Effect.Tag pattern consistently

  ### Testing Improvements
  - 2000+ lines of comprehensive protocol tests
  - Contract-based testing for all transport implementations
  - Type-safe schema validation throughout

  ### Developer Experience
  - Added `bun run ci` command for local CI validation
  - Simplified API surface with better type inference
  - Consistent error handling across all packages

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`b7da1d2`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b7da1d24b822cf3b7853f659a6df161b7c6126e5)]:
