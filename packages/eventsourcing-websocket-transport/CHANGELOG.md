### Patch Changes

- [#60](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/60) [`e61e1da`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/e61e1da32d2fecafc0e6e638cb0ca0daa49fada7) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix prepublishOnly script to maintain build dependency chain

  The prepublishOnly script was doing a clean build (`clean && build`) which broke the dependency chain established by Turbo's build ordering. This caused packages that depend on other workspace packages to fail TypeScript compilation during publishing because their dependencies' TypeScript definitions weren't available.

  Changed prepublishOnly from `bun run clean && bun run build` to just `bun run build` to maintain the build artifacts and dependency chain established by the main build process.

### Patch Changes

- [#58](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/58) [`b391253`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b391253c9b298de5d8712b147a4bfefff4295a90) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix TypeScript definition generation in build process

  The build process was not properly generating TypeScript definition files for published packages due to incremental compilation cache issues. This fix adds the `--force` flag to the TypeScript compiler to ensure definition files are always generated during the build process.

  This resolves issues where consumers of these packages would not have proper TypeScript intellisense and type checking.

## 0.3.4

### Patch Changes

- [#57](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/57) [`10bc57b`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/10bc57b88b396f9536d0ec3afa670f41991b181c) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix workspace protocol dependencies in published packages

  The published packages incorrectly included `workspace:*` protocol in their dependencies, making them impossible to install outside the monorepo. This was caused by changesets not supporting Bun's workspace protocol.

  The fix updates the release workflow to:
  1. Run `bun update` after versioning to resolve workspace references
  2. Use `bun publish` directly instead of `changeset publish`
  3. Run `changeset tag` to create git tags after publishing

  This ensures published packages have proper version constraints instead of workspace protocols.

  This patch verifies that the changeset publish process properly replaces workspace:\* with actual version numbers when publishing to npm.

  ### Service Definition Patterns
  - **BREAKING**: Renamed `EventStoreServiceInterface` to `EventStore` for cleaner naming
  - **BREAKING**: Renamed `ProjectionStoreServiceInterface` to `ProjectionStore`
  - **BREAKING**: Renamed `SnapshotStoreServiceInterface` to `SnapshotStore`
  - Updated `CommandContext` and `CurrentUser` services to use `Effect.Tag` pattern with proper interfaces
  - Removed deprecated `EventStore<TEvent>` interface (was already marked deprecated)

  ### Documentation Improvements
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to core APIs
  - Added examples showing pipe composition patterns with currying
  - Documented error types with `@throws` tags
  - Added `@since` tags for version tracking

  ### Type Safety Enhancements
  - Fixed service tag patterns for better type inference
  - Standardized generic parameter ordering across all packages

  ### Migration Guide

  Update your imports:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import type { EventStoreServiceInterface } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store';

  // After
  import type { EventStore } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store';
  ```

  Update service definitions:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  class MyEventStore extends Effect.Tag('MyEventStore')<
    MyEventStore,
    EventStoreServiceInterface<MyEvent>
  >() {}

  // After
  class MyEventStore extends Effect.Tag('MyEventStore')<MyEventStore, EventStore<MyEvent>>() {}
  ```
