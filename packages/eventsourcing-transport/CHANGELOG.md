## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/136) [`d3f18d4`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/d3f18d4100fa466a2b98b83721deb7c2c29de5d2) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Add npm as dev dependency to support OIDC trusted publishing

  Installs npm 11.6.1+ as a dev dependency to enable OIDC trusted publishing in GitHub Actions. This eliminates the need for long-lived NPM_TOKEN secrets when publishing packages to the npm registry.

  This change improves the development experience by implementing a git worktree-based workflow that provides better isolation between feature development and the main branch. The `/start` slash command now creates isolated worktrees for each feature, and the `/automerge` command properly cleans up worktrees after successful merges.

  Key benefits for developers:
  - Complete isolation of feature branches in separate working directories
  - Eliminates risk of contaminating main branch with uncommitted changes
  - Allows working on multiple features simultaneously
  - Each worktree maintains its own node_modules and mise configuration
  - Automatic mise trust and dependency installation in new worktrees

  Enhanced the CI workflow to use a more intelligent cache strategy that enables better cache reuse across commits and between PR runs and main branch builds. CI builds now complete significantly faster when dependencies haven't changed.

  This is purely an internal development workflow improvement that does not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

- [#128](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/128) [`5cac87e`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/5cac87e9edf83c7b8fce8f1ba0c51d576ca92c6d) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improve development workflow with enhanced validation scripts

  Enhanced the internal validation and release preparation scripts to use modern Turbo-based architecture. Package validation is now faster and more reliable thanks to improved caching and parallel execution. The validation process now properly separates discovery, orchestration, and execution concerns for better maintainability.

  Changes are purely internal to the development workflow and do not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#106](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/106) [`5a8c349`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/5a8c349aedf08d7f9eecc23ff801acd1f9e0e511) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - **BREAKING CHANGE**: Rename package from `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-transport-contracts` to `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-transport`

  The transport contracts package has been renamed to better reflect its role as the core transport abstraction layer. No API changes - only the package name has changed.

### Patch Changes

- [#101](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/101) [`d4063a3`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/d4063a351d83d2830e27dfc88972559de74096db) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce consistent Effect syntax by forbidding Effect.gen usage

  Adds ESLint rule to prevent use of Effect.gen in favor of pipe-based Effect composition. This ensures consistent code style and encourages the use of the more explicit pipe syntax throughout the codebase. All existing Effect.gen usage has been refactored to use Effect.pipe patterns.

- [#99](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/99) [`b8fa706`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b8fa706fa4a99772979dca89079205dbd257e3dc) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Remove all vitest dependencies and references in favor of bun:test

  All packages now use bun:test instead of vitest for testing. This change removes vitest as a dependency across all packages while maintaining the same testing functionality. Test imports have been updated from 'vitest' to 'bun:test' and configuration files have been cleaned up to remove vitest references.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix release pipeline failures caused by TypeScript build issues

  The release process was failing because packages with `workspace:*` dependencies were rebuilding during publish via `prepublishOnly` hooks. This caused TypeScript compilation errors when dependent packages tried to build in parallel without access to their dependencies' declaration files.

  **Solution:**
  - Removed `prepublishOnly` hooks from all packages (turbo already handles build order correctly)
  - Updated release script to use `changeset publish` directly instead of custom turbo publish tasks
  - Ensured all packages are built in dependency order before publishing begins

  This ensures a smooth release process where:
  1. All packages build in correct dependency order (respecting workspace dependencies)
  2. Changesets handles publishing with proper version resolution
  3. No parallel rebuild issues during the publish phase

- [#79](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/79) [`5720964`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/57209643dd18db0fb876d898fd48796042270eaa) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Simplified release validation using changesets' native tools. The CI now validates:
  - Changeset status to ensure changes have appropriate version bumps
  - Build success for all packages
  - Publish readiness via changesets publish --dry-run

  This provides focused, relevant validation without unnecessary checks, ensuring smooth releases while keeping CI fast and maintainable.

### Patch Changes

- [#73](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/73) [`7cec47a`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/7cec47a3cf6741febd99f96dec4cadb1923543c2) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Documentation updates to match current codebase implementation:
  - Fixed incorrect package names and import paths
  - Updated API examples and function signatures
  - Corrected WebSocket usage patterns
  - Removed outdated temporary documentation

- [#74](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/74) [`ff5231c`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/ff5231c27122a47839b3aedf162c00f30f5e3257) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improved CI validation to prevent release failures. The changeset validation now:
  - Detects when code changes are made without changesets (preventing npm republish failures)
  - Checks if package versions already exist on npm
  - Provides clear guidance on creating changesets with consumer-focused messages
  - Distinguishes between code changes (requiring changesets) and documentation-only changes (optional)
