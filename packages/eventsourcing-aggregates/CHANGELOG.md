### Minor Changes

- [#157](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/157) [`2b03f0f`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/2b03f0faea585e54ac3488f6f5f9c97629eb1222) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Remove deprecated Command type export and clean up legacy code

  **BREAKING CHANGE**: The deprecated `Command` type export has been removed from `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands`. Use `WireCommand` instead for transport layer commands.
  - Removed deprecated `Command` type export - use `WireCommand` for clarity about transport layer vs domain commands
  - Updated all internal references from `Command` to `WireCommand`
  - Removed migration guides and backward compatibility documentation
  - Cleaned up legacy helper functions and test comments

  To update your code:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import { Command } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands';

  // After
  import { WireCommand } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands';
  ```

- [#170](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/170) [`4e9f8c9`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/4e9f8c9711df00e01b0ab943dad67aa14d59df06) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce domain-specific event types throughout the command processing layer. Command handlers and routers are now generic over your domain event types, preventing accidental use of generic `Event` types with `unknown` data in domain code.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - `CommandHandler` and `CommandRouter` are now generic interfaces that require a type parameter
  - `createCommandProcessingService` now requires an event store tag parameter before the router parameter
  - Factory functions with default type parameters have been removed from service tag creation

  **Migration:**

  Before:

  ```typescript
  const handler: CommandHandler = {
    execute: () => Effect.succeed([{ type: 'Created', data: {...} } as Event])
  };

  const service = createCommandProcessingService(router);
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  // 1. Define domain events
  const MyEvent = Schema.Union(Created, Updated);
  type MyEvent = typeof MyEvent.Type;

  // 2. Create domain-specific event store tag
  const MyEventStore = Context.GenericTag<EventStore<MyEvent>, EventStore<MyEvent>>('MyEventStore');

  // 3. Use typed handlers
  const handler: CommandHandler<MyEvent> = {
    execute: () => Effect.succeed([{ type: 'Created', data: {...} }])
  };

  // 4. Provide event store tag to factory
  const service = createCommandProcessingService(MyEventStore)(router);
  ```

  The generic `Event` type remains available for serialization boundaries (storage implementations, wire protocol) but should not be used in domain logic.

  See ARCHITECTURE.md for detailed design rationale and migration guidance.

Command initiator is now supplied when creating aggregates and event schemas. The originator field optionality is configurable by the caller.

### Patch Changes

- [#200](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/200) [`1a4b174`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/1a4b1743ba8edd7bf1a359468bae5dc8218ddf43) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enhanced ESLint rules to better detect unnecessary function wrappers. The custom rule now correctly identifies when `(x) => pipe(x, fn)` is redundant while allowing valid cases like `(x) => pipe(SomeService, fn)`. This improves code quality by preventing unnecessary indirection while preserving valid functional composition patterns.

- [#199](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/199) [`a6482b6`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/a6482b69a1070b62654e63fb501fd6346413b50f) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improve code quality by using idiomatic Effect patterns

  The codebase now uses `Effect.andThen()` instead of `Effect.flatMap(() => ...)` when sequencing effects that don't need the previous result, and `Effect.as()` instead of `Effect.map(() => constant)` when replacing values with constants. These changes make the code more readable and better reflect the intent of each operation, following Effect.ts best practices.

- [#175](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/175) [`8503302`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/850330219126aac119ad10f0c9471dc8b89d773a) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce simplified pipe usage patterns

  This update improves code maintainability and readability by enforcing consistent functional programming patterns. The codebase now exclusively uses the standalone `pipe()` function instead of method-based `.pipe()` calls, eliminates nested pipe compositions in favor of named helper functions, and removes curried function calls. These changes make the code easier to understand and debug while maintaining the same functionality.

- [#198](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/198) [`460784f`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/460784fb8d0c31b1d5b4b122d73a4807e2ce9bbe) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix all TypeScript code examples in documentation to pass validation. All examples now compile successfully with proper imports, type declarations, and adherence to functional programming patterns using pipe() composition.

- [#206](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/206) [`322a7ab`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/322a7aba4778b3f2e1cf4aa6ad4abc37414af8a7) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - CI workflow now uses concurrency groups to prevent duplicate workflow runs when the release bot updates PRs. This eliminates wasted compute resources from race conditions in GitHub's API-based commit handling.

- [#196](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/196) [`d299e17`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/d299e17bf5084b7785beca46d5b5b837a610792e) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix command initiator type handling. CommandContextService.getInitiator no longer wraps the initiator in Option - optionality is now controlled by the schema passed to CommandContext. Renamed CurrentUser to CommandContextError.

- [#159](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/159) [`04e27b8`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/04e27b86f885c7a7746580f83460de3be7bae1bb) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix turbo cache invalidation for lint tasks to ensure CI properly detects code changes
  - Simplified lint task input patterns to prevent cache inconsistencies
  - Added tracking for root package.json and bun.lock to invalidate cache when dependencies change
  - Added missing TSX test file patterns to ensure all test files are tracked
  - Removed duplicate and non-existent file patterns that were causing unreliable cache behavior

  This ensures that lint errors are always caught in CI and prevents false-positive builds from stale cache.

- [#169](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/169) [`abfb14d`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/abfb14d261138b629a31a2b0f86bd17b77f56720) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Modernized service definitions to use Effect-TS 2.3+ patterns. Services now use `Context.Tag` instead of `Effect.Tag` with inlined service shapes, providing better type inference and cleaner code. Generic services use the `Context.GenericTag` factory pattern for proper type parameter support.

  For most users, these are internal improvements with no breaking changes. If you're directly referencing service types (like `CommandRegistryService`), use `Context.Tag.Service<typeof ServiceName>` to extract the service type instead.

- [#203](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/203) [`d2b1c32`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/d2b1c329050725ad7dad65442514387972d1d1f4) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Code quality improvements: All packages now follow stricter functional programming patterns by removing type assertions in Effect callbacks. The codebase uses proper Schema validation and runtime type checking instead of unsafe type casts, improving type safety and code reliability.

- [#179](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/179) [`02f67ff`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/02f67ffe83a70fceebe5ee8d848e0a858529319b) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Replace direct `_tag` property access with Effect type guards throughout the codebase. This change improves type safety and follows Effect's recommended patterns for working with discriminated unions. The transport packages now properly validate incoming messages using Schema validation instead of unsafe type casts.

- [#173](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/173) [`5f5fff2`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/5f5fff2cadd8109bf81adac0ab79e53cbeb8b7b2) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Improved readability of command processing by reducing nested pipe calls. The command processing factory now uses Effect.all to run independent effects in parallel with descriptive names, making the code flow clearer while maintaining identical behavior.

- [#194](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/194) [`433331d`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/433331d25e58b347954aa73ff8836c74bbe73660) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Enforce strict branded ID types throughout aggregate root operations. The `load()` and `commit()` functions now require explicitly typed aggregate IDs instead of accepting plain strings. Event metadata schema now correctly includes the `originator` field with proper type safety. This prevents accidental use of unvalidated string IDs and ensures compile-time enforcement of branded types like `UserId` or `OrderId` throughout the aggregate lifecycle.

- [#178](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/178) [`f4c06d6`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/f4c06d6430f61976ec9c28af38faac39f88800d1) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Refactored pipe usage patterns to comply with simplified functional composition rules. All `pipe(fn(x), ...)` patterns have been converted to `pipe(x, fn, ...)` for better readability and consistency. This change also fixes Effect type signatures to properly use `never` instead of `unknown` in context parameters where appropriate.

  Added comprehensive immutability checks using ESLint's functional programming rules to enforce readonly types throughout the codebase. This improves type safety by preventing accidental mutations of parameters and return values.
  - Added `type-fest` dependency where needed for `ReadonlyDeep` utility type
  - Applied `ReadonlyDeep` to function parameters requiring deep immutability
  - Added `readonly` modifiers to arrays and interface properties
  - Strategic ESLint disable comments for Effect library types that require internal mutability

  These changes ensure better type safety without affecting runtime behavior or breaking existing APIs.

  This change improves the development experience by implementing a git worktree-based workflow that provides better isolation between feature development and the main branch. The `/start` slash command now creates isolated worktrees for each feature, and the `/automerge` command properly cleans up worktrees after successful merges.

  Key benefits for developers:
  - Complete isolation of feature branches in separate working directories
  - Eliminates risk of contaminating main branch with uncommitted changes
  - Allows working on multiple features simultaneously
  - Each worktree maintains its own node_modules and mise configuration
  - Automatic mise trust and dependency installation in new worktrees

  Enhanced the CI workflow to use a more intelligent cache strategy that enables better cache reuse across commits and between PR runs and main branch builds. CI builds now complete significantly faster when dependencies haven't changed.

  This is purely an internal development workflow improvement that does not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

  Enhanced the internal validation and release preparation scripts to use modern Turbo-based architecture. Package validation is now faster and more reliable thanks to improved caching and parallel execution. The validation process now properly separates discovery, orchestration, and execution concerns for better maintainability.

  Changes are purely internal to the development workflow and do not affect the public API or runtime behavior of any packages.

### Minor Changes

- [#92](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/92) [`a4f4377`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/a4f4377d6641723ee40a1ca2a62b828c094f753f) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Add Command Processing Service to bridge ServerProtocol and EventStore operations

  This release introduces the Command Processing Service, which provides the missing orchestration layer between server protocol commands and event store operations. This service enables automatic command handling, event storage, and proper error handling in event sourcing applications.

  **New exports:**
  - `CommandProcessingService` - Effect service tag for command processing
  - `CommandProcessingServiceInterface` - Service interface for command processing operations
  - `createCommandProcessingService` - Factory function to create service implementations
  - `CommandHandler` - Interface for individual command handlers
  - `CommandRouter` - Interface for routing commands to appropriate handlers
  - `CommandProcessingError` - Error type for general processing failures
  - `CommandRoutingError` - Error type for command routing failures

  **Key features:**
  - **Complete command flow**: Automatically processes commands from ServerProtocol through to EventStore storage
  - **Type-safe error handling**: Proper tagged errors with Effect error handling patterns
  - **Flexible routing**: Simple Map-based command routing to handlers
  - **Effect integration**: Seamless integration with EventStore and Effect ecosystem
  - **Testing support**: Comprehensive test coverage with real EventStore integration

  **Usage:**

  ```typescript
  import {
    CommandProcessingService,
    createCommandProcessingService,
    CommandRouter
  } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-aggregates';

  // Create command router
  const router: CommandRouter = {
    route: (command) => // route to appropriate handler
  };

  // Create service layer
  const CommandProcessingServiceLive = Layer.effect(
    CommandProcessingService,
    createCommandProcessingService(router)
  );

  // Use in application
  const result = pipe(
    CommandProcessingService,
    Effect.flatMap(service => service.processCommand(command)),
    Effect.provide(CommandProcessingServiceLive)
  );
  ```

  This service completes the event sourcing architecture by connecting command handling to event storage with proper orchestration.

  Eliminate duplicate APIs and ensure consistent Effect terminology throughout the codebase. All factory functions now use the Effect `make*` convention, and redundant aliases have been removed for a cleaner API surface.
  - Replace `create*` factory functions with `make*` (Effect convention)
  - Update WebSocket layer terminology (`createWebSocketProtocolStack` → `makeWebSocketProtocolLayer`)
  - Remove backward compatibility aliases and redundant exports
  - Standardize all test interface methods to use Effect naming patterns

  This cleanup eliminates API confusion and ensures developers have single, canonical names for each piece of functionality following proper Effect patterns.

- [#112](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/112) [`e0c59ca`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/e0c59ca1ac5e235502d4efce137fda05ffe7418d) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Implement immutable command registry with compile-time exhaustive command name validation. The new system provides complete type safety for command dispatch while maintaining clean API design.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - Command registry is now immutable - all commands must be registered at construction time
  - Removed mutable `register()` methods in favor of declarative configuration
  - Updated error handling to use structured error types instead of strings

  **New Features:**
  - Exhaustive command name matching prevents dispatching unknown commands at compile time
  - Immutable command registry with zero runtime mutations
  - Type-safe command validation with Effect Schema integration
  - Comprehensive command result types with detailed error information

  **Developer Experience:**
  - Clean, minimal API focused on behavior over type demonstrations
  - Compile-time guarantees for command name validity
  - Automatic type inference for command payloads and handlers
  - Simplified test suite focused on actual functionality

- [#103](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/103) [`0c99b22`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/0c99b22849ba2a0b9211790b0f3334c3a7a0471e) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Separate CQRS command types into dedicated package for better architecture

  **New Package: `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-commands`**
  - Introduces a dedicated package for CQRS command types and schemas
  - Contains `Command` and `CommandResult` schemas that were previously in the store package
  - Establishes proper separation between domain concepts (commands) and event storage
  - Includes comprehensive test coverage and documentation

  **Breaking changes for `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store`:**
  - Removed `Command` and `CommandResult` types - these are now in the commands package
  - Store package now focuses purely on event streaming and storage concepts
  - Updated description to reflect pure event streaming focus

  **Updated packages:**
  - `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-aggregates`: Updated to import command types from commands package
  - `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-protocol-default`: Updated to import command types from commands package

  This change establishes cleaner architectural boundaries:
  - **Store**: Pure event streaming and storage
  - **Commands**: CQRS command types and schemas
  - **Aggregates**: Domain modeling (uses both events and commands)
  - **Protocol**: Transport implementation (uses both events and commands)

  **Breaking changes for `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store`:**
  - Added new domain types `Command`, `Event`, and `CommandResult` schemas that were previously only available in the protocol package
  - These core domain types are now available directly from the store package for better separation of concerns

  **Improvements for `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-aggregates`:**
  - Fixed architectural violation by removing dependency on protocol implementation
  - Aggregate roots now only depend on store abstractions, creating cleaner layer separation
  - Import domain types directly from store package instead of protocol package

  **Improvements for `@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-protocol`:**
  - Domain types (`Command`, `Event`, `CommandResult`) are now imported from store package and re-exported for convenience
  - Maintains backward compatibility while improving architectural boundaries

  This change establishes cleaner separation between domain concepts (in store) and transport protocols, making the packages more modular and easier to understand.

  Adds ESLint rule to prevent use of Effect.gen in favor of pipe-based Effect composition. This ensures consistent code style and encourages the use of the more explicit pipe syntax throughout the codebase. All existing Effect.gen usage has been refactored to use Effect.pipe patterns.

  **BREAKING CHANGE**: InMemoryStore is now exported as a namespace module instead of individual exports.

  Before:

  ```typescript
  import { make } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store-inmemory';
  const store = await make();
  ```

  After:

  ```typescript
  import { InMemoryStore } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store-inmemory';
  const store = await InMemoryStore.make();
  ```

  This change aligns with Effect library conventions where modules like Queue, Ref, etc. are exported as namespaces containing their functions.

  This change improves the testing experience by:
  - Converting manual Effect.runPromise calls to Effect-aware test runners (it.effect, it.live, it.scoped)
  - Adding proper scoped resource management for transport lifecycle tests
  - Using Effect-specific assertions and custom equality matchers for Effect types
  - Leveraging automatic TestServices provision (TestClock, etc.) in effect tests
  - Implementing cleaner layer sharing patterns where appropriate
  - Reducing test boilerplate and improving readability

  All existing tests continue to pass while providing a better developer experience for Effect-based testing.

  The release process was failing because packages with `workspace:*` dependencies were rebuilding during publish via `prepublishOnly` hooks. This caused TypeScript compilation errors when dependent packages tried to build in parallel without access to their dependencies' declaration files.

  **Solution:**
  - Removed `prepublishOnly` hooks from all packages (turbo already handles build order correctly)
  - Updated release script to use `changeset publish` directly instead of custom turbo publish tasks
  - Ensured all packages are built in dependency order before publishing begins

  This ensures a smooth release process where:
  1. All packages build in correct dependency order (respecting workspace dependencies)
  2. Changesets handles publishing with proper version resolution
  3. No parallel rebuild issues during the publish phase

  The prepublishOnly script was doing a clean build (`clean && build`) which broke the dependency chain established by Turbo's build ordering. This caused packages that depend on other workspace packages to fail TypeScript compilation during publishing because their dependencies' TypeScript definitions weren't available.

  Changed prepublishOnly from `bun run clean && bun run build` to just `bun run build` to maintain the build artifacts and dependency chain established by the main build process.

  The build process was not properly generating TypeScript definition files for published packages due to incremental compilation cache issues. This fix adds the `--force` flag to the TypeScript compiler to ensure definition files are always generated during the build process.

  The published packages incorrectly included `workspace:*` protocol in their dependencies, making them impossible to install outside the monorepo. This was caused by changesets not supporting Bun's workspace protocol.

  The fix updates the release workflow to:
  1. Run `bun update` after versioning to resolve workspace references
  2. Use `bun publish` directly instead of `changeset publish`
  3. Run `changeset tag` to create git tags after publishing

  This ensures published packages have proper version constraints instead of workspace protocols.

  The `write` method on the EventStore interface has been renamed to `append` to more accurately reflect its purpose - events can only be appended to the end of a stream, not written arbitrarily. The method signature and behavior remain the same, with the position parameter used for optimistic concurrency control to detect conflicts.

  ### Breaking Changes
  - `EventStore.write()` is now `EventStore.append()`
  - All implementations and usages have been updated accordingly

  ### Migration Guide

  Update all calls from:

  ```typescript
  eventStore.write(position);
  ```

  To:

  ```typescript
  eventStore.append(position);
  ```

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### EventStore Interface Simplified

  The EventStore interface now has just three methods:
  - `write`: Write events to a stream
  - `read`: Read historical events only (no live updates)
  - `subscribe`: Read historical events then continue with live updates

  ### Removed APIs
  - **Removed `readHistorical` method** - Use `read` instead (it now returns only historical events)
  - **Removed `ReadParams` and `ReadOptions` types** - Use EventStreamPosition with Stream combinators
  - **Removed complex parameter overloading** - Methods now have single, clear parameter types

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Reading Historical Events

  ```typescript
  // Before
  eventStore.readHistorical({ streamId, eventNumber });

  // After
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber });
  ```

  ### Advanced Operations with Stream Combinators

  ```typescript
  // Reading a range (before)
  eventStore.read({
    streamId,
    fromEventNumber: 50,
    toEventNumber: 100,
  });

  // Reading a range (after)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber: 50 }).pipe(
    Effect.map(Stream.take(51)) // take events 50-100
  );

  // Reading in reverse (before)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, direction: 'backward' });

  // Reading in reverse (after)
  eventStore
    .read({ streamId, eventNumber: 0 })
    .pipe(
      Effect.map(
        flow(Stream.runCollect, Effect.map(Chunk.reverse), Effect.flatMap(Stream.fromChunk))
      )
    );
  ```

  ## Benefits
  - **Clearer API**: Explicit separation between historical reads and live subscriptions
  - **Simpler types**: No complex union types or parameter overloading
  - **Better composability**: Leverage Effect's powerful Stream combinators
  - **Smaller API surface**: Fewer methods to understand and maintain

  ## Notes

  This change removes theoretical optimizations that were never implemented (like database-level filtering for ranges). These can be added back as specialized methods if performance requirements demand it in the future.
