- [#58](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/58) [`b391253`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b391253c9b298de5d8712b147a4bfefff4295a90) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Fix TypeScript definition generation in build process

  The build process was not properly generating TypeScript definition files for published packages due to incremental compilation cache issues. This fix adds the `--force` flag to the TypeScript compiler to ensure definition files are always generated during the build process.

  This resolves issues where consumers of these packages would not have proper TypeScript intellisense and type checking.

- Updated dependencies [[`b391253`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/b391253c9b298de5d8712b147a4bfefff4295a90)]:

  The published packages incorrectly included `workspace:*` protocol in their dependencies, making them impossible to install outside the monorepo. This was caused by changesets not supporting Bun's workspace protocol.

  The fix updates the release workflow to:
  1. Run `bun update` after versioning to resolve workspace references
  2. Use `bun publish` directly instead of `changeset publish`
  3. Run `changeset tag` to create git tags after publishing

  This ensures published packages have proper version constraints instead of workspace protocols.

  This patch verifies that the changeset publish process properly replaces workspace:\* with actual version numbers when publishing to npm.

### Minor Changes

- [#49](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/49) [`ee425bf`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/ee425bf5f0be3e0f6b08f18591ce4b3a13764b76) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - Rename EventStore `write` method to `append` for better semantic clarity

  The `write` method on the EventStore interface has been renamed to `append` to more accurately reflect its purpose - events can only be appended to the end of a stream, not written arbitrarily. The method signature and behavior remain the same, with the position parameter used for optimistic concurrency control to detect conflicts.

  ### Breaking Changes
  - `EventStore.write()` is now `EventStore.append()`
  - All implementations and usages have been updated accordingly

  ### Migration Guide

  Update all calls from:

  ```typescript
  eventStore.write(position);
  ```

  To:

  ```typescript
  eventStore.append(position);
  ```

### Patch Changes

- [#47](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/pull/47) [`73ca9d4`](https://github.com/CodeForBreakfast/eventsourcing/commit/73ca9d44adca717e75edc04b6dd6d02fdd8afbf1) Thanks [@GraemeF](https://github.com/GraemeF)! - feat!: Simplify EventStore API to just read and subscribe methods

  ## Breaking Changes

  ### EventStore Interface Simplified

  The EventStore interface now has just three methods:
  - `write`: Write events to a stream
  - `read`: Read historical events only (no live updates)
  - `subscribe`: Read historical events then continue with live updates

  ### Removed APIs
  - **Removed `readHistorical` method** - Use `read` instead (it now returns only historical events)
  - **Removed `ReadParams` and `ReadOptions` types** - Use EventStreamPosition with Stream combinators
  - **Removed complex parameter overloading** - Methods now have single, clear parameter types

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Reading Historical Events

  ```typescript
  // Before
  eventStore.readHistorical({ streamId, eventNumber });

  // After
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber });
  ```

  ### Advanced Operations with Stream Combinators

  ```typescript
  // Reading a range (before)
  eventStore.read({
    streamId,
    fromEventNumber: 50,
    toEventNumber: 100,
  });

  // Reading a range (after)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, eventNumber: 50 }).pipe(
    Effect.map(Stream.take(51)) // take events 50-100
  );

  // Reading in reverse (before)
  eventStore.read({ streamId, direction: 'backward' });

  // Reading in reverse (after)
  eventStore
    .read({ streamId, eventNumber: 0 })
    .pipe(
      Effect.map(
        flow(Stream.runCollect, Effect.map(Chunk.reverse), Effect.flatMap(Stream.fromChunk))
      )
    );
  ```

  ## Benefits
  - **Clearer API**: Explicit separation between historical reads and live subscriptions
  - **Simpler types**: No complex union types or parameter overloading
  - **Better composability**: Leverage Effect's powerful Stream combinators
  - **Smaller API surface**: Fewer methods to understand and maintain

  ## Notes

  This change removes theoretical optimizations that were never implemented (like database-level filtering for ranges). These can be added back as specialized methods if performance requirements demand it in the future.

  - Updated to use `read()` instead of `readHistorical()` for loading aggregate state
  - Projections package now correctly maps legacy `readHistorical` calls to new `read()` method
  - Both packages maintain backward compatibility while using the new simplified API internally

  ### Documentation Improvements
  - Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to core APIs
  - Added examples showing pipe composition patterns with currying
  - Documented error types with `@throws` tags
  - Added `@since` tags for version tracking

  ### Type Safety Enhancements

  - Standardized generic parameter ordering across all packages

  ### Migration Guide

  Update your imports:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  import type { EventStoreServiceInterface } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store';

  // After
  import type { EventStore } from '@codeforbreakfast/eventsourcing-store';
  ```

  Update service definitions:

  ```typescript
  // Before
  class MyEventStore extends Effect.Tag('MyEventStore')<
    MyEventStore,
    EventStoreServiceInterface<MyEvent>
  >() {}

  // After
  class MyEventStore extends Effect.Tag('MyEventStore')<MyEventStore, EventStore<MyEvent>>() {}
